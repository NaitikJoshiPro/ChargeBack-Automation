2. Evidence Collection  
   Consolidation of payment, communication, and transaction data across internal systems.

3. Rebuttal Generation  
   Automated creation of compliant rebuttals using trained AI models and templated structures.

4. Submission and Logging  
   Controlled upload of generated case packets with complete traceability.

5. Outcome Evaluation  
   Continuous performance tracking and feedback integration for win-rate optimization.
